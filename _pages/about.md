Hello my dear guest :) Welcome to my personal web page! I'm an automation engineer, who loves to spend the time by doing research about technology and watching football games accompanied by weiss beer :) 

In this web page, there is some info about my academic and business background. In the future, I'm planning to share some notes for Python and PLC programming. I hope it will be helpful to improve yourself.

Enjoy surfing my web page :) Ciao!
